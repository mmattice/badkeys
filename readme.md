Bad Keys
========

This is a project like [BadSSL](https://badssl.com) that contains bad keys, such
as an RSA key with a public exponent of 1.

This collection of keys exists solely for research and testing purposes.

# Never Use These Keys In Production

Actually don't use any random key you find on the internet.
